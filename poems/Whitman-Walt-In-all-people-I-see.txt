In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barleycorn less, 
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.

And I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow, 
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means. 

And I know I am deathless, 
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass, 
I know I shall not pass like a child's curlicue cut with a burnt stick at night. 

I am know I am august, 
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood, 
I see that the elementary laws never apologize, 
I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by after all. 

I exist as I am, that is enough, 
If no other in the world be aware I sit content, 
And if each and all be aware I sit content. 

One world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself, 
And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years, 
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait. 

My foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite, 
I laugh at what you call dissolution, 
And I know the amplitude of time.
